# weird-pong
Weird Pong is a pong-like action-adventure rogue-like mini-game-like ping-pong-like god-simulator. It is an existential exploration of the world, our place in it, and what it means to be a tiny rectangle in the face of a cruel, uncaring world. Taking inspiration from games such as [INSERT REALLY GOOD GAME], Weird Pong will leave you maybe the same as when you started (best case scenario), no takesie-backsies.
